##### Content
The dataset includes two files, the description file with all required meta information and annotations *tcg.json* 
and the data file *tcg_data.npy* with the 3D pose sequences.

### Baseline Models

Download the baseline models from google drive and unzip the .zip file in the baselines directory:

https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Kz-7PpSkucCSBWcrL9K3fTotxhNgWAaa/view?usp=sharing

### Training

Make sure the requirements are satisfied in your environment, and the dataset is downloaded. 
Change configuration and hyperparameters in /config/config.py as you like and run 

```
python config.py
```

to initialize config.ini. Then  run

```
python main.py 
```
You can also play with the hyperparameters using the /config/config.py. 


### Evaluation

To reproduce the quantitative results in our paper, run the provided script:
```
python evaluate.py
```
